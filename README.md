# WRF-Python-Basics
This repository shows the programs made during the internship in Amity COAST department !

I am a data science enthusiast , and this time working on WRF files , basically these files consist of weather data !

I am making a .py file which will be eligible to process the WRF files and give you the graphs you require ,
for example : If you require the trend of SLP as a variable the interface will give you the complete trend of the day for the particular variable.

Would be happy if I can learn something more in this domain and would be ready to help anyone in programming related to it if possible !
